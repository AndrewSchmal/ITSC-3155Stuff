# For this exercise, accept a string input from the user and pass that input to a function. That function should 
# count the lowercased letters (and only the letters, meaning we ignore anything not a letter and treat each 
# letter as lowercase regardless of its actual case) of the string in a dictionary and then return that 
# dictionary. Print out the resulting dictionary returned by the function.

# Accept 5 integer inputs from the user and print the sum. Different in this exercise is that you cannot trust 
# the user, just like in real life. You must validate that the input is actually an integer and cannot rely on 
# the user always entering integers. If the user enters something other than a valid integer, print an error 
# message and make them enter the number again until they enter 5 integers and you can print the sum.

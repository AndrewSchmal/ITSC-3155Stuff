<!-- #3 Find an inspirational quote. Create an HTML page with a "div" tag and put the
quote as text inside the div. Use embedded CSS (in the "style" tag inside the
"head" tag) to make the text bold and the div bordered with a background color
and some additional padding above and below the text. Use any color combination
you wish, just please don't make my eyes bleed too much. -->

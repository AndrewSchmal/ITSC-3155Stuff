<!-- # 6 Create an index.html page and add a <script> tag to the body. In the script tag, write some JavaScript that waits 5 seconds before popping up an alert box which should show a random number from 0 to 1. If the number is less than 0.5, then the message should print "{number} is less than 0.5", otherwise print "{number} is greater than or equal to 0.5", where {number} is the random number. You will need to use your resources to figure out how to accomplish this in JavaScript. -->

    <!-- 
    Used setTimeout() function to execute a piece of code after x milliseconds, in this case 5000 = 5 sec
    Used math.random to return a random number between 0 (including 0) and 1 (exclusive)
    use if else to check if the number is either < .5 or >= .5

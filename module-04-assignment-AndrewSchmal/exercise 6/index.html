<!-- #6 Create an HTML page called "index.html" and an external CSS stylesheet called "styles.css". Set the body to use a different font than the default and a different background color than the default. Create a header, "Hello World" with an ID of "main-title" and style that ID to be centered. Create two paragraphs, each with a class of "content" and apply a bottom margin of 12px to that class. By the end, your site should look something like this, but with whichever font and color you choose:  -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <header id="main-title">Hello World</header>
    <p class="content">
      This is the first paragraph of content. What should I add to it? Who knows. I had to temporarily disable
      the Prettier extension on VS Code, because it was not letting me hit space within the p class.
      Isn't that annoying? I can understand stopping me the first time if you think I'm gonna break 
      something but if I keep persistently hitting space, just let me do it, it's probably not an accident.
    </p>
    <p class="content">This is the second paragraph of content. Like, you would think they would show
      an indication that Prettier was stopping me from using spaces, but no, I had to go down the list of
      a bunch of extensions I don't even remember installing. At least HTML/CSS/JS are interpreted like Python which makes
      code update automatically sometimes.
    </p>
